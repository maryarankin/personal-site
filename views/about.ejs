            <div class="px-5 mt-5">
                <p>My name is Mary Rankin and I am a student at University of Florida, pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>
                <p>I also have a B.A. in Psychology with a minor in Biology from Barnard College of Columbia University.</p>
                <p>I currently work at PrecisionUSA, where I primarily manage their ecommerce website and provide IT support for the company.</p>
                <p>At PrecisionUSA, I also implemented the current system used to collect and manage sales tax across the country to remain in compliance</p>
                <p>with each state's tax laws.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I have learned about various web development technologies, such as Node, React, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose,</p>
                <p>and Bootstrap. One of my personal projects is a <a id="small-link" href="http://restaurantsim.xyz/home">web application game</a> created with Node, Express, and MongoDB that allows users</p>
                <p>to create their own restaurant.</p>
                <p>I have also worked on a number of projects in Java and C++ for my coursework at UF. This has included, most recently, an implementation</p>
                <p>of the game Minesweeper using SFML with C++.</p>
